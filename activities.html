                    <p>One of the major goals of a college club is to make learning fun and less stressful. We as a club organize various programs to achieve this goal.
                    We organize many programs where all students are welcome to participate. Our main event is the treasure hunt we organize once every year in the spring semester.
                    Other than treasure hunt we also organize study sessions, field visits, seminars and conferences. Some of our activities are mentioned below;</p>

                        Treasure hunt is a unique gaming event that tests a student's mental as well as physical sharpness. Participants can compete themselves or form groups with friends.
                    The winners of the contest are rewarded with gifts and all the participants are awarded certificate of participation. The game has a series of questions one needs to solve.
                    Questions are mostly related to coding and the participants are needed to write programs in the language of their own selection. A volunteer will look at the program and upon his/her green signal
                    the participant(s) can proceed to their next task which will be a physical test(like scoring baskets 3 times in a row or successfully completing a spoon race).
                    After the physical part has been completed, the participant(s) can then proceed to their next clue. The first team to successfully complete all the tasks and find the treasure is the winner.

                        Every student has different questions and not all of it can be answered by a single professor who teaches 20+ students at a time. Realising this fact,
                        we decided to provide our students with the platform to ask questions freely in the study session. The student who has answer to the question gets to answer it and if unsatisfied
                        then they can start a discussion. If no conclusion is achieved then the  question is forearded to a professor. We help students with any questions they want to ask be it an assignment or quiz or test question.
                        This helps students in making their studies easier and effective.

                    An important aspect of academia is to give students practical knowledge along with theoritical knowledge. So, CodeForFun organizes various field visits to different It companies
                        in and around Vancouver and lower mainland. Students get to learn the practical implementation of the things they learn in their class and also have a chance to meet experts in the fields.
                        This is a great way of creating connection among various people in different fields.
