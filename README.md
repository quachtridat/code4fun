# code4fun
This is the code for the website of our club, FDU Code4Fun. We are the first IT club in Fairleigh Dickinson University, Vancouver campus, and our goal is to help IT students in the school to study better, as well as to find the joy in programming.

This website is a project that helps our club members have a better grasp of web developing, and aims to become a platform in which we can share helpful articles and knowledge to other IT students in our university in the future.
